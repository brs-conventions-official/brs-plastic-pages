    "description": "The objective of the Plastic Free Rivers and Seas for South Asia Project is to strengthen innovation and coordination of circular economy solutions to plastic pollution flowing into South Asian Seas. The Project has three components. Component 1. Supporting Competitive Block Grant Investments to Reduce Plastic Waste will identify, verify and invest in circular plastic economy solutions and facilitate the exchange of knowledge and awareness of these solutions. Subcomponent 1.1: Investing in Circular Solutions to Reduce Plastic Waste will support circular plastic economy solutions to reduce plastic waste by implementing a program of regional competitive block grant investments. Subcomponent 1.2: Promoting Knowledge Exchange and Awareness will facilitate the exchange of circular plastic economy knowledge between Eligible Regional Competitive Block Grant (RBG) Beneficiaries and selected South Asian countries and promotes awareness raising activities. 2. Leveraging Public and Private Sector Engagement and Solutions component will provide support to develop and/or improve national and regional plastic pollution mitigation strategies and action plans, policies and industry standards. Subcomponent 2.1: Enabling Policies, Standards, and Analytics will support the development of strategies, action plans, policies, and standards to harmonize plastic pollution mitigation measures through: (a) developing and implementing a multi-year plastic policy support program, working with leading universities and organizations; (b) developing a database for lifecycle analysis, data collection, and modeling related to plastic across selected industry value chains; and (c) supporting communication activities. Subcomponent 2.2: Enabling Regional Public and Private Engagement will support circular use of plastic in the economy through regional public-private collaboration and engagement in South Asia, including designing and organizing annual or more frequent meetings of representatives from public and private sector. 3. Strengthening Regional Integration Institutions component will strengthen regional organizations’ capacity to coordinate and to support their member-states to better deliver on solutions to mitigate plastic pollution that flows into rivers and seas across South Asia and transition to a more circular plastic economy. Subcomponent 3.1: Building South Asia Cooperative Environment Program’s (SACEP’s) Institutional Capacity will support SACEP’s ability to convene and coordinate with regional organizations, line ministries and governments, including to uniformly collect, analyze and interpret pollution data will better inform policy and decision making support for investment planning, design and implementation. Subcomponent 3.2: Project Management will support SACEP in the implementation and overall management of the Project.",

    "description": "The objective of the Kota Kinabalu Composting Project for Malaysia is to avoid methane (a greenhouse gas) emissions from the Kayu Madang Sanitary Landfill in Telipok, Malaysia by diverting the municipal solid waste (MSW) to a sorting and composting plant, which will recover the recyclable portion of the waste and convert the highly biodegradable portion of the waste into marketable compost. Aerobic decomposition of the organic portion of MSW into reusable compost generates carbon dioxide (C02) instead of methane (Ch) that will have been generated as a result of the anaerobic decomposition of MSW disposed in a landfill. The project key indicators will be: (i) the amount of compost produced (tons/year), and (ii) the certified emission reduction (CER) credits created and traded annually (tons of COz-e). This clean development mechanism (CDM) project consists of two components: (a) the construction and operation of a sorting and composting facility; and (b) a carbon finance transaction. The first component of the project is involves construction of a 500 tons day capacity sorting and corn posting plant in Telipok, Sabah State of Malaysia. This plant will process MSW from the City of Kota Kinabalu and three neighboring districts (Kota Belud, Tuaran, and Penampang). Kota Kinabalu City Hall has agreed to provide Smart Recycling approximately 18 acres of land to set up and operate this plant within the Kayu Madang Sanitary Landfill site. Approximately 3.2 acres were designated for the sorting plant and administrative buildings, and the remaining area was conceived for the corn posting plant. The sorting plant started operation in April 2006, and the composting plant is expected to be constructed in 2008 and operational by April 2009. The second component of the project is World Bank managed Carbon Fund for Europe (CFE) will finance the purchase of CER credits resulting from avoided landfill gas production at the Kayu Madang Sanitary Landfill. The purchase will be a performance-based contract under which payments are triggered by successful verification of the reduction of methane emissions by an independent, accredited international entity called the Designated Operating Entity (DOE), under the rules of the Kyoto Protocol.",
