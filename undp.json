    "description": "The objective of the GEF PPG is to develop the project concept into a full project: “Transforming Nauru’s Food Systems through Climate Smart Agriculture”. As described in the child project concept note of the Food Systems Integrated Program (FSIP), this project aims to implement Nauru’s Climate Smart Agriculture Plan (NaCSAP) to contribute to food and nutrition security. NaCSAP is a holistic, island-wide approach that is vertically integrated and coordinated through a whole-of-government platform. There is also integration of national priorities such as reducing import dependency/ increasing food and nutrition security and addressing sustainable development, environmental conservation related commitments, and the SDGs.The project is designed to showcase sustainable food production systems within the context of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) to achieve food security, enhance nutrition diversity, and improve health and well-being while simultaneously protecting critical ecosystems, including coastal, marine, and vital freshwater resources. It aims to assist Nauru in incorporating nature-smart and climate-resilient food production solutions into the NaSCAP. These solutions are nature-smart by conserving freshwater, preventing coastal and marine pollution, managing plastic waste from tunnel agriculture, minimizing chemical inputs, and addressing invasive species management—a prevalent issue in the Pacific. Additionally, the project will employ innovative technologies to conserve land, water, and coastal areas. The climate-resilient aspects include water conservation measures, the utilization of weather-proof greenhouses, and the reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) using renewable energy sources for cooling systems and fertilizer conveyance.",

As plastic waste pollution and its associated environmental impacts are exacerbated by multiple factors, a holistic approach is proposed that integrates convening power, systems thinking, institutional capacity building, education and awareness-building, technological innovation and on-the-ground action to accelerate the transition to a CE, leveraging actors from across the public, private and civil society sector due to the multi-stakeholder nature of the issue.",

There is a pressing need for holistic solutions that address these root causes comprehensively.The National Plastic Action Partnership (NPAP) is a collaborative initiative spearheaded by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Global Plastic Action Partnership (GPAP). Its aim is to tackle the global challenge of plastic pollution by bringing together stakeholders from various sectors to develop and implement strategies that reduce plastic pollution and transition towards a circular economy. This can be achieved through 1) establishing organizational and operation procedures of NPAP and developing stakeholder engagement mechanism, 2) generate evidences from studies that feed into national action roadmap and community engagement, and 3) strengthening coordination and collaborations for initiatives on plastic action.UNDP Philippines will act as the NPAP Secretariat for the Philippines. The NPAP Secretariat in the Philippines will play a critical role in coordinating and implementing the NPAPs initiatives in the country.",
