Identification of sustainable alternative materials to plastics, and innovative packaging and recycling technologies; and 2. Plastics value chain in the target countries and their regulatory frameworks. By running 2 study streams at the same time, the outcome would be linked to each other to identify the gaps between needs and supplies as well as opportunities and challenges in target countries. On the course of studies, consultation seminars and workshops will be organized which would work also for matchmaking purposes as well as awareness development towards reduction of marine plastic litter.\n\nTo this end, the project is expected to contribute to provide an overview of available technology options matching with local contexts and needs in order to reduce the amount of virgin plastic usage in packaging and single-use products in the target African countries.",

The impact of the importation of plastics will be tackled through the enforcement of stricter regulations with respect to single-use plastics and pollutants.\n\nThe project will support the Moroccan plastics industry who are ready to comply, stimulating their engagement to anticipate the need for highly recyclable materials. Partnerships with existing UNIDO implemented projects in Morocco are expected to bring public-private, cross-sector, interagency collaborations, and additional innovative financing.\nThe actions will extend along the whole value chain, through the creation of standards to tackle pollutants in food and beverage plastics. Policy instruments will be revised, starting with already existing measures and ongoing work on the national waste legislation, thus supporting policy coherence across varying government agencies and business sectors. Ultimately, the efforts will lead to the establishment of Extended Producer Responsibility schemes, which will not only help tackle the downstream side of the plastic cycle, but investment would be unlocked from industry to support the recycling sector and encourage the establishment of local business and job creation.",

    "name": "Development and demonstration of innovative technologies for value-adding applications of plastic waste from Indian paper mills in rubber and other industries (Paper phase III)",
    "description": "\nSince 2019, UNIDO has implemented a project titled ‘Firm-level demonstration of technologies and productivity enhancement measures for the Indian pulp and paper industry’, wherein innovative technologies for productivity enhancements have been adapted to Indian process conditions and demonstrated through transportable pilot units in paper mills across the country. During implementation, industry stakeholders expressed the need for a viable solution to address the issue of plastic wastes generated in recycled-fibre based mills. UNIDO has undertaken preliminary experiments in collaboration with subject matter experts to explore potential technology options for utilization of plastic waste for application of generated by-products in other industries and energy generation.\n\nThe proposed project aims to develop and demonstrate a potential solution to this problem related to disposal/utilization of plastic wastes from paper mills. The objective of the project is to establish a techno-economically viable option for the utilization of plastic wastes generated in recycled fibre-based paper mills through pyrolytic thermochemical conversion and explore value-adding applications in allied industries, such as rubber, for resultant by-products as a way of improving resource efficiency and productivity in target industries. The main focus of the project is to facilitate bench-level experiments and pilot trials to demonstrate and optimize process parameters for (i) thermochemical conversion of plastic waste generated in paper mills into oil, char and syn gases through thermo-chemical treatment as well as to explore potential for (ii) utilization of the resultant oil as diesel grade oil and/or as a boiler fuel  for blending applications along with diesel fuel in paper mills; (iii) utilization of the resultant char as replacement of carbon black in rubber industries as a compounding agent (or similar applications); and (iv) utilization of resultant syn gaseous fractions for heating of thermochemical conversion reactor for sustaining the energy requirement of the process.\n\nThe demonstrations under the project are expected to provide a sustainable solution for the utilization of plastic wastes generated in recycled fibre-based paper mills. The pyrolytic treatment of these plastic wastes would provide an additional energy source for paper mills, thereby enhancing their resource efficiency, and also reduce dependence on fossil-based energy as well as incineration/landfilling as a disposal strategy. Further, the demonstrations are expected to increase productivity of the rubber production process, by encouraging industrial symbiosis and making use of char produced through pyrolytic conversion of plastic wastes as a compounding agent in rubber industries.",
